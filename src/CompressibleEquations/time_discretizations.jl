$(TYPEDEF)

Abstract supertype for the outer Runge–Kutta scheme that drives the acoustic
substep loop. The current implementation supports a single concrete subtype:

    fractions ``β = (1/3, 1/2, 1)``. This is the only outer scheme supported
    today and the default for [`SplitExplicitTimeDiscretization`](@ref).

The interface exists to make the outer-scheme commitment explicit in the
type system and to provide a clean extension point for a future Multirate
Infinitesimal Step (MIS) outer scheme. A concrete subtype is expected to
provide a [`stage_fractions`](@ref) method returning its stage-fraction tuple.

abstract type AcousticDampingStrategy end

"""
$(TYPEDEF)

No acoustic divergence damping. The substep loop advances perturbation
fields without applying any post-substep momentum correction. **Default.**
"""
struct NoDivergenceDamping <: AcousticDampingStrategy end

"""
$(TYPEDEF)

3-D acoustic divergence damping that uses the **(ρθ)′ tendency as a
discrete proxy for the momentum divergence**. From the linearized
ρθ-continuity equation
``\\partial_t (ρθ)' + \\nabla\\cdot(ρθ^0 u') = 0``, the per-substep
quantity

```math
D \\equiv \\frac{(ρθ)' - (ρθ)'_\\mathrm{old}}{θ^0}
       \\approx -Δτ \\, \\nabla\\cdot(ρu)'
```

is what would otherwise require an extra divergence operator and an
extra kernel pass. Building the correction from `D` reuses the
substep's already-resident `(ρθ)′` snapshots — that's the algorithmic
choice this damping is named for.

Used by
[Klemp, Skamarock & Ha (2018)](@cite KlempSkamarockHa2018) /
[Skamarock & Klemp (1992)](@cite SkamarockKlemp1992) /
[Baldauf (2010)](@cite Baldauf2010). After each acoustic substep, all
three momentum perturbation components ``(ρu)′, (ρv)′, (ρw)′`` pick up
a correction proportional to ``\\nabla D``. The vertical component is the
piece that damps vertical acoustic modes and is REQUIRED for
stability at production ``\\Delta t``: without it, the column tridiag's
anti-symmetric buoyancy off-diagonals and asymmetric (under
stratified ``\\bar\\theta(z)``) PGF off-diagonals make the substep
operator non-normal with ``\\|U\\|_2 \\gg 1``, and a rest atmosphere
amplifies ~1.8× per outer step.

Per-substep momentum correction (Klemp, Skamarock & Ha 2018 eq. 36, MPAS form):

```math
Δ(ρu)′ = -γ · ∂_x D , \\quad
Δ(ρv)′ = -γ · ∂_y D , \\quad
Δ(ρw)′ = -γ_z · ∂_z D
```

with a single isotropic horizontal damping diffusivity (mirroring
MPAS's `coef_divdamp = 2·smdiv·config_len_disp/Δτ`):

```math
γ = α \\, d^2 / Δτ , \\qquad d^2 \\equiv Δx · Δy ,
\\qquad γ_z = α \\, Δz² / Δτ .
```

``α`` is the dimensionless Klemp 2018 coefficient (= MPAS
`config_smdiv`, default `0.1`). The combined 2-D horizontal
explicit-time stability bound is ``8α ≤ 2 → α ≤ 0.25``; the default
sits well below it. Combined with the `SplitExplicitTimeDiscretization`
default ``\\omega = 0.65``, this keeps both the rest atmosphere at
machine ε at Δt = 20 s and the DCMIP-2016 dry / moist baroclinic
waves stable at their production ``\\Delta t``.

Fields
======

- `coefficient`: Dimensionless damping coefficient ``α`` (Klemp 2018 /
  MPAS `config_smdiv`). Default `0.1`. The vertical part is folded into
  the column tridiag and is unconditionally stable, so this coefficient
  may be raised above the explicit-time bound `α ≤ 0.25` to suppress
  non-normal transient amplification of the vertical acoustic mode.
  The horizontal part remains explicit and obeys the usual `8α ≤ 2`
  2-D combined CFL.
- `length_scale`: Optional override for the dispersion length ``d``.
  Default `nothing` (auto: ``d² = Δx · Δy``). Setting `length_scale = ℓ`
  forces ``γ = α \\, ℓ² / Δτ``.
- `damp_vertical`: If `true`, the vertical part of the divergence
  damping is folded into the column tridiag (a Laplacian on `(ρw)′`).
  If `false` (default), no extra vertical damping is applied — the
  vertical acoustic modes are damped solely by the off-centering of the
  implicit pressure-gradient solve (``\\omega > 0.5``), which Klemp et
  al. 2018 eq. (32) shows is algebraically equivalent to a vertical
  divergence damping with diffusivity ``γ_y = c² Δτ s/2`` where
  ``s = 2\\omega - 1``.

$(TYPEDEF)

4th-order *hyperdiffusive* horizontal divergence damping. Identical in
structure to [`ThermalDivergenceDamping`](@ref) — the per-substep
momentum correction is the gradient of a (ρθ)′-tendency proxy divided
by `θᴸ` at the face — but the proxy is replaced by the **horizontal
Laplacian** of the (ρθ)′ tendency:

```math
Δ(ρu)' = +γ · ∂x[\\nabla_h^2 ((ρθ)' - (ρθ)'^{s-})] / θ^0_face
Δ(ρv)' = +γ · ∂y[\\nabla_h^2 ((ρθ)' - (ρθ)'^{s-})] / θ^0_face
```

The Laplacian inside makes the operator 4th-order in horizontal
wavenumber, so its damping rate scales as ``k^4`` rather than the
``k^2`` of the standard 2nd-order Klemp form. The practical effect is
that grid-scale noise (`k Δx ≈ π`) is hit ~10× harder while resolved
features (`k Δx ≈ 0.05`) are barely touched. This is the right tool
when you want to suppress acoustic noise without polluting the BCI /
gravity-wave signal at the resolved scales.

The vertical-component handling is the same as `ThermalDivergenceDamping`:
folded into the column tridiag if `damp_vertical = true`, off otherwise
(then off-centering supplies vertical damping per Klemp eq. 32).

Fields
======

- `coefficient`: Dimensionless damping coefficient ``α``. Defined so
  the actual hyperdiffusivity used in the kernel is
  ``γ = α · d^4 / Δτ`` with ``d² ≡ Δx · Δy`` — i.e. one extra factor
  of ``d²`` compared to the 2nd-order Klemp form. With this scaling
  the per-substep diffusion CFL ``γ Δτ k^4 ≤ 2`` collapses to
  ``α π^4 ≤ 2``, giving the explicit-stability bound
  ``α ≤ 2/π^4 ≈ 0.02``. The safe default is therefore an order of
  magnitude smaller than `ThermalDivergenceDamping`'s ``α = 0.1``.
  Default `0.001`.
- `length_scale`: Optional override for the dispersion length;
  enters as ``γ = α · ℓ^4 / Δτ``.
- `damp_vertical`: Whether to apply the vertical Laplacian piece in
  the column tridiag. Default `false`.

Pressure-extrapolation divergence damping (WRF / ERF form). Following
[Klemp, Skamarock & Ha (2018)](@cite KlempSkamarockHa2018), WRF
(`smdiv`, `module_small_step_em.F`), and ERF (`beta_d`,
`ERF_Substep_T.cpp`), this damping does **not** add a post-substep
correction to horizontal momentum. Instead, it forward-biases the
``(ρθ)'`` used in the **horizontal** acoustic pressure-gradient force
of each substep:

```math
(ρθ)'_\\mathrm{pgf} \\;=\\; (ρθ)' \\;+\\; α \\, ((ρθ)' - (ρθ)'_\\mathrm{lagged})
```

where ``(ρθ)'_\\mathrm{lagged}`` is the value at the **end of the
previous substep** (zero at the first substep of an RK stage). For
acoustic modes oscillating with period ``\\sim 2 Δτ`` the bias is
large and damps the mode; for slow rotational/balanced modes where
``(ρθ)'`` barely changes between substeps it's a no-op.

The vertical acoustic tridiag is **not** biased — only the explicit
horizontal PGF in `_explicit_horizontal_step!` reads the biased field.
This matches ERF's `theta_extrap`-only-in-horizontal usage; vertical
damping comes from off-centering (``ω > 1/2``).

$(TYPEDEF)

Direct divergence damping. Unlike [`ThermalDivergenceDamping`](@ref), which
estimates the momentum divergence via the
``(ρθ)' - (ρθ)'_\\mathrm{old}`` proxy à la
[Klemp, Skamarock & Ha (2018)](@cite KlempSkamarockHa2018), this strategy
computes the horizontal divergence ``D = ∂_x (ρu)' + ∂_y (ρv)'`` directly
at cell centers and applies the damping:

```math
Δ(ρu)' = +γ_m \\, ∂_x D , \\qquad
Δ(ρv)' = +γ_m \\, ∂_y D
```

with ``γ_m = α_m \\, d^2`` (units m², a per-substep diffusion length
squared) and ``d^2 = Δx · Δy``. The 2-D combined explicit-Euler
stability bound is ``α_m ≤ 0.25`` (same as `ThermalDivergenceDamping`).
Note the *absence* of the ``/Δτ`` in `γ_m`: K18's ``γ = α · d^2 / Δτ``
has the ``/Δτ`` only because the proxy ``(ρθ)' - (ρθ)'_\\mathrm{old} \\approx
-Δτ \\, θ̄ \\, ∇\\!·m`` already carries an extra ``Δτ`` that cancels.

Direct divergence avoids the proxy's approximations:

- No linearization of the (ρθ) flux.
- No contamination by the slow tendency ``Δτ \\, G^s_{ρθ}`` (which
  carries WENO-advection grid-scale dispersive errors into the proxy).
- No vertical-acoustic leakage from ``∂_z(θᴸ ρw')``: only horizontal
  divergence enters.

# Optional (ρθ)′ smoothing

Setting ``α_θ > 0`` adds a Laplacian smoothing on the thermodynamic
perturbation,
[Skamarock & Klemp (1992)](@cite SkamarockKlemp1992)-style:

```math
Δ(ρθ)' = +γ_θ \\, ∇_h^2 (ρθ)'
```

with ``γ_θ = α_θ \\, d^2`` (same dimensional logic as ``γ_m`` above).
This damps the **PE half-cycle** of the
acoustic mode that momentum-only damping leaves alone, the (ρθ)/p oscillation
that re-excites momentum each acoustic period. It's a numerical
hyperviscosity on (ρθ)' — no enthalpy source/sink, just spatial smoothing
of the perturbation. Resolved baroclinic gradients see some smoothing too,
but with grid-scale e-folding ~minutes and 4-grid-cell e-folding ~days,
the resolved physics is barely touched.

Default ``α_θ = 0`` recovers the K18 / MPAS / WRF / ERF behavior of
damping momentum only.

$(TYPEDEF)

Split-explicit time discretization for compressible dynamics.

Outer integration is the Wicker–Skamarock RK3 scheme
([Wicker and Skamarock 2002](@cite WickerSkamarock2002)) with stage
fractions ``β = (1/3, 1/2, 1)``. Within each stage, an inner substep loop
evolves linearized acoustic perturbations about the outer-step-start
state. The vertically implicit solve uses an off-centered Crank-Nicolson
scheme with off-centering parameter ``\\omega`` (default 0.5 = classic
centered CN).

The substep distribution across stages is selectable via the
[`AcousticSubstepDistribution`](@ref) interface.

Fields
======

- `substeps`: Number of acoustic substeps ``N`` per outer ``Δt``. Default
  `nothing` adaptively chooses ``N`` from the horizontal acoustic CFL each
  step.
- `forward_weight`: Off-centering parameter ``\\omega`` for the vertically
  implicit solve. ``\\omega = 0.5`` is classic centered Crank-Nicolson;
  the default ``\\omega = 0.65`` adds modest off-centering
  (``\\varepsilon = 2\\omega - 1 = 0.3``). Combined with the default
  divergence damping, it keeps a rest atmosphere at machine ε at
  production ``\\Delta t = 20`` s and survives the DCMIP-2016 dry/moist
  baroclinic-wave smoke tests at production grid.

  **Note on residual non-normality** (Phase 4 of
  `validation/substepping/PRISTINE_SUBSTEPPER_PLAN.md`): the column
  tridiag has anti-symmetric buoyancy off-diagonals (gravity-wave
  physics) and asymmetric PGF off-diagonals on a stratified ``\\bar\\theta(z)``,
  so the substep operator ``U`` has spectral radius ``\\rho(U) = 1``
  but operator norm ``\\|U\\|_2 \\gg 1`` (≈ 44 at ``\\Delta t = 20`` s,
  ``\\omega = 0.55``, no damping). Distributed FP-noise excites the
  non-normal transient-amplification subspace, leading to a
  rest-atmosphere blow-up at default ``\\omega = 0.55``. Klemp 3-D
  divergence damping shrinks ``\\|U^k\\|`` over enough ``k`` and breaks
  the soft outer-step CFL — it is REQUIRED for stability at production
  ``\\Delta t``.
- `damping`: Acoustic divergence damping strategy. Default:
  [`ThermalDivergenceDamping`](@ref) with coefficient 0.1. Required for
  stability at production ``\\Delta t``; passing
  [`NoDivergenceDamping`](@ref) will cause the rest atmosphere to
  amplify ~1.8× per outer step at ``\\Delta t = 20`` s.

  three WS-RK3 stages.
