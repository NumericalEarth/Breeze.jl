##### Acoustic substepping for CompressibleDynamics
#####
##### The substepper evolves linearized acoustic perturbations between WS-RK3
##### stages, with the linearization refreshed to the **stage-entry state**
##### Uᴸ_stage at the start of each RK stage (per Skamarock & Klemp 2008).
##### Prime notation denotes the perturbation about Uᴸ_stage:
#####
#####   ρ′    = ρ   − ρᴸ
#####   (ρθ)′ = ρθ  − ρθᴸ
#####   (ρu)′ = ρu  − ρuᴸ,  (ρv)′ = ρv − ρvᴸ,  (ρw)′ = ρw − ρwᴸ
#####
##### Background quantities θᴸ = ρθᴸ/ρᴸ, Πᴸ = (pᴸ/pˢᵗ)^κ, and γᵐRᵐᴸ are
##### cached per stage; ρᴸ, ρθᴸ, pᴸ, ρuᴸ, ρvᴸ, ρwᴸ are read live from the
##### model since the substep loop never mutates those fields.
#####
##### The linearized perturbation equations integrated by the substep loop:
#####
#####   ∂t ρ′    +     ∇·((ρu)′, (ρv)′, (ρw)′)        = Gˢρ
#####   ∂t (ρθ)′ +     ∇·(θᴸ · ((ρu)′, (ρv)′, (ρw)′)) = Gˢρθ
#####   ∂t (ρu)′ + ∂x pᴸ + ∂x(Cᴸ (ρθ)′)               = Gˢρu
#####   ∂t (ρv)′ + ∂y pᴸ + ∂y(Cᴸ (ρθ)′)               = Gˢρv
#####   ∂t (ρw)′ +         ∂z(Cᴸ (ρθ)′) + g · ρ′      = Gˢρw
#####
##### where Cᴸ = γᵐRᵐᴸΠᴸ. The discrete PGF uses the gradient of the
##### cell-centered product Cᴸ(ρθ)′.
#####
##### Time discretization: horizontal momentum updates are forward-Euler
##### with MPAS-style first-small-step sequencing (the first substep of a
##### multi-substep stage includes the frozen ∇pᴸ force but skips the
##### perturbation acoustic horizontal PGF, which enters on later substeps).
##### The vertical ((ρw)′, (ρθ)′, ρ′) coupling is
##### solved implicitly with an off-centered Crank-Nicolson scheme —
##### `forward_weight = 0.5` is classic centered CN (neutrally stable for
##### the linearized inviscid system), `forward_weight > 0.5` adds
##### dissipation. The implicit step reduces to a tridiagonal Schur system
##### in (ρw)′ at z-faces.
#####
##### After each stage's substep loop, the full prognostic state is
##### recovered: ρ = ρᴸ + ρ′, ρθ = ρθᴸ + (ρθ)′, ρu = ρuᴸ + (ρu)′, etc.,
##### and velocities are diagnosed from momenta and density.
#####
##### Notation note (Standard S13): the symbols `σ`, `η` are RESERVED in
##### atmospheric science for vertical coordinates (sigma and hybrid).
##### This module uses prime notation for perturbations and the in-code
##### kernel arguments map as
#####   ρ′    ↔ kernel arg `ρ′`     (struct field: density_perturbation)
#####   (ρθ)′ ↔ kernel arg `ρθ′`    (density_potential_temperature_perturbation)
#####   (ρu)′ ↔ kernel arg `ρu′`    (momentum_perturbation.u)
#####   (ρv)′ ↔ kernel arg `ρv′`    (momentum_perturbation.v)
#####   (ρw)′ ↔ kernel arg `ρw′`    (momentum_perturbation.w)
##### Predictors carry a `★` suffix: `ρ′★`, `ρθ′★`.

$(TYPEDEF)

Storage and parameters for the split-explicit acoustic substepper.

The substepper evolves linearized acoustic perturbations between WS-RK3
stages, with the linearization refreshed to the stage-entry state
``Uᴸ_\\mathrm{stage}`` at the start of each RK stage. ``ρᴸ, ρθᴸ, pᴸ`` and
the stage-entry momenta are read live from `model.dynamics.*` and
`model.momentum.*` (untouched by the substep loop). Three derived
quantities ``Πᴸ = (pᴸ/pˢᵗ)^κ``, ``θᴸ = ρθᴸ/ρᴸ`` and ``γᵐRᵐᴸ`` are
computed once per stage and cached as fields, since recomputing them
inline at each call site is significantly slower on H100.

The vertical implicit solve uses a centered (or off-centered)
Crank-Nicolson scheme that reduces to a tridiagonal Schur system for the
vertical-momentum perturbation ``(ρw)′``.

Fields
======

- `substeps`: Number of acoustic substeps ``N`` per outer ``Δt`` (or
  `nothing` for adaptive).
- `forward_weight`: Off-centering parameter ``\\omega``. ``\\omega = 0.5``
  is classic centered CN; the default is 0.65.
- `damping`: Acoustic divergence damping strategy.
- `substep_distribution`: How acoustic substeps are distributed across
  the WS-RK3 stages.

Stage-entry linearization point:

The substep loop never mutates `model.dynamics.density`, the formulation's
prognostic ρθ field, or `model.dynamics.pressure` — those are the
**stage-entry** ρᴸ, ρθᴸ, pᴸ throughout the substep loop and serve as the
recovery base for `_recover_full_state!`. No separate snapshot fields
are stored.

- `linearization_exner`: ``Πᴸ = (pᴸ/pˢᵗ)^κ`` cached from the live `pᴸ`.
- `linearization_potential_temperature`: ``θᴸ = ρθᴸ/ρᴸ`` for the perturbation
  temperature flux ``θᴸ · μ``.

Perturbation prognostics (advanced inside the substep loop):

- `density_perturbation`: ``ρ′ = ρ − ρᴸ``.
- `density_potential_temperature_perturbation`: ``(ρθ)′ = ρθ − ρθᴸ``.
- `momentum_perturbation`: ``(ρu)′, (ρv)′, (ρw)′`` fields grouped as
  `.u`, `.v`, and `.w`.

Per-column scratch (column kernel only):

- `density_predictor`, `density_potential_temperature_predictor`: explicit
  predictors built before the implicit vertical solve.
- `previous_density_potential_temperature_perturbation`: ``η`` from the
  previous substep, used by Klemp 2018 damping.

Time-averaged velocity for non-acoustic scalar transport (WRF/MPAS-style
dynamics-transport split):

- `time_averaged_velocities`: velocity tuple returned by
  `transport_velocities(model)` so moisture/tracer/chemistry/TKE tendencies
  advect against the acoustic-mean velocity, not a single snapshot. The slow
  thermodynamic `ρθ` tendency is computed separately with the current RK
  predictor velocity; it is not routed through this cache.

Vertical solve:

- `slow_vertical_momentum_tendency`: assembled vertical-momentum slow
  tendency ``Gˢρw`` at z-faces (advection + Coriolis + closure + forcing,
  with PGF and buoyancy excluded — those live in the fast operator).
- `vertical_solver`: `BatchedTridiagonalSolver` for the implicit ``(ρw)′`` update.

# Off-centered CN tridiag derivation
# ----------------------------------
# At face k, the perturbation `(ρw)′` equation in CN form is
#
#   (ρw)′_n(k) = (ρw)′_o(k) + Δτ Gˢρw(k)
#                - Δτ × (ωˢ⁻ ∂z p′_o + ωᵐ⁺ ∂z p′_n)
#                - Δτ × g × (ωˢ⁻ ρ′_face_o(k) + ωᵐ⁺ ρ′_face_n(k))
#
# with ωᵐ⁺ = (1+ε)/2, ωˢ⁻ = (1-ε)/2 (ε=0 is centered CN).
# The linearized pressure perturbation is local:
#   p′ = Cᴸ (ρθ)′,  Cᴸ ≡ γRᵐᴸ Πᴸ,
# so the discrete pressure-gradient force is the gradient of the product
# `Cᴸ * (ρθ)′`, not `Cᴸ_face * ∂z(ρθ)′`.
#
# The post-solve substitution (matching the column kernel):
#   ρ′_n(k)    = ρ′★(k)  - δτᵐ⁺ × ((ρw)′_n(k+1) - (ρw)′_n(k)) / Δz_c(k)
#   (ρθ)′_n(k) = ρθ′★(k) - δτᵐ⁺ × (θᴸ_face(k+1) (ρw)′_n(k+1)
#                                        - θᴸ_face(k)   (ρw)′_n(k)) / Δz_c(k)
# where δτᵐ⁺ = ωᵐ⁺ Δτ.
#
# Substituting yields the tridiagonal coefficients (ω = ωᵐ⁺):
#
#   A[k,k+1] = -(ω Δτ)² × Cᴸ(k)   × θᴸ_face(k+1) × rdz_c(k)   / Δzᶠ(k)
#              - (ω Δτ)² × g          × rdz_c(k)   / 2
#
#   A[k,k]   = 1 + (ω Δτ)² × θᴸ_face(k) × (Cᴸ(k) rdz_c(k) + Cᴸ(k-1) rdz_c(k-1)) / Δzᶠ(k)
#                + (ω Δτ)² × g                              × (rdz_c(k) - rdz_c(k-1)) / 2

#
# `γᵐRᵐᴸ` is the cell-centered mixture coefficient `γᵐ Rᵐ` cached in
# `linearization_gamma_R_mixture`, refreshed once per stage from the live
# moisture state. It is interpolated to z-faces inside the kernel. For
# dry runs (qᵛ = qˡ = qⁱ = 0) this collapses bit-identically to the dry
# constant `γᵈRᵈ`.
#
# Implicit vertical damping
# -------------------------
# When `damping isa ThermalDivergenceDamping` with `damp_vertical = true`,
# the vertical part of the divergence damping is folded into the same tridiag.
# Reformulating the kernel correction `Δ(ρw)′ = -γ_z ∂z D` via the linearized
# (ρθ)′ continuity equation gives a discrete vertical Laplacian on `(ρw)′`:
#
#   (ρw)′_n − ω α Δz² ∂z² (ρw)′_n = (ρw)′_o + (1−ω) α Δz² ∂z² (ρw)′_o
#
# At face k the −∂z² stencil contributes (with `dᵐ⁺ ≡ ω α Δz²`):
#
#   A[k,k+1] += -dᵐ⁺ × rdz_c(k)   / Δzᶠ(k)
#   A[k,k]   += +dᵐ⁺ × (rdz_c(k) + rdz_c(k-1)) / Δzᶠ(k)
#   A[k,k-1] += -dᵐ⁺ × rdz_c(k-1) / Δzᶠ(k)
#
# The matching `(1−ω) α Δz² ∂z² (ρw)′_o` term is added to the predictor's
# right-hand side in `_build_predictors_and_vertical_rhs!`. The constant-
# Courant scaling `γ_z = α Δz² / Δτ` makes `dᵐ⁺` and the RHS prefactor
# independent of Δτ; only `α`, `ω`, and `minimum_zspacing(grid)` enter.
# When `damp_vertical = false` (or for `NoDivergenceDamping`), the damping
# factor passed in is zero and the tridiag reduces to the pure off-
# centered CN acoustic system above.

##### Section 7 — Slow vertical-momentum tendency assembly

##### The full vertical-momentum equation is

##### The dynamics kernel runs in `SlowTendencyMode` for SplitExplicit,
##### which zeroes the PGF and buoyancy in `Gⁿρw`. We reinstate the
##### **Uᴸ-state** PGF and buoyancy here so the slow ρw tendency has the
##### form
#####   Gˢρw = -∇·(ρw u)  -  ∂z(pᴸ - pᵣ)  -  g · (ρᴸ - ρᵣ)   (with reference)
#####   Gˢρw = -∇·(ρw u)  -  ∂z pᴸ        -  g · ρᴸ           (no reference)
##### and the per-substep linearized forces operate on the perturbations:
#####   ∂t (ρw)′ = Gˢρw - γRᵐ · Πᴸ · ∂z((ρθ)′)  -  g · ρ′
##### Total force = Gˢρw + perturbation force = full ∂t(ρw) at the
##### linearization-consistent level. With a hydrostatic-balanced reference
##### state, the reference subtraction makes Gˢρw vanish identically on a
##### resting atmosphere (no FP-rounding noise).

# Initialize perturbation prognostics at the start of each WS-RK3 stage.
# Per Skamarock & Klemp 2008 (above eq. 16), the substep variables are
# deviations from the **most recent RK3 predictor** (= linearization base
# Uᴸ, refreshed by `prepare_acoustic_cache!` immediately before this).
# But the WS-RK3 invariant ``U^{(k)} = U(t) + β_k Δt R(U^{(k-1)})``
# requires each stage to integrate from U(t) (= the outer-step-start
# state held in `model.timestepper.U⁰` ≡ `Uᴸ_outer`). The standard trick
# (WRF `small_step_prep`, MPAS) is to initialize the perturbations to
# the **rewind term** ``(U_\\mathrm{outer} − Uᴸ)`` so that the substep's
# starting full state ``Uᴸ + (U_\\mathrm{outer} − Uᴸ) = U_\\mathrm{outer}``
# regardless of where Uᴸ was refreshed to. For stage 1 the rewind is
# zero (Uᴸ = U_\\mathrm{outer}); for stages 2 and 3 the rewind picks up
# the previous-stage update. Recovery from `_recover_full_state!` then

##### The slow thermodynamic `ρθ` tendency is part of the acoustic system and

##### We accumulate raw `momentum_perturbation` into the

##### `model.momentum.*` is the stage-entry momentum (the substep loop only
##### touches `momentum_perturbation`, not the model's momentum), and
##### `model.dynamics.density` holds the stage-entry density — both serve
