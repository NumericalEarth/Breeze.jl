#####
##### Direction-aware advective timescale for the time-step wizard
#####
##### The `TimeStepWizard` floats Δt at a target advective CFL by calling
##### `cell_advection_timescale(model)` — a `minimum` over the grid of
#####
#####   τ = 1 / (|u|/Δx + |v|/Δy + |w|/Δz).
#####
##### Adaptive implicit vertical advection (AIVA) removes the *vertical* advective CFL as a
##### stability constraint: its explicit vertical velocity is `wᵉ = w · min(1, cfl/α)`, so the
##### explicit vertical CFL is `min(α, cfl) ≤ cfl` regardless of Δt. When every vertically-advected
##### prognostic uses AIVA, the vertical term therefore imposes no restriction and should drop out
##### of the timescale — otherwise the wizard would still clamp Δt to a transient fast updraft and
##### AIVA would buy nothing at the run level. This mirrors Oceananigans' vertically-implicit
##### diffusion, whose `cell_diffusion_timescale` returns `Inf` for the same reason.
#####
##### `cell_advection_timescale(model::AtmosphereModel)` (the wizard's default) makes this choice
##### automatically from `model.advection`; `CellAdvectionTimescale(formulation)` is the explicit
##### override for forcing or monitoring a particular direction (see its docstring) — e.g. to watch
##### the true three-dimensional CFL even while the wizard floats Δt on the horizontal one.

$(TYPEDSIGNATURES)

A callable that returns the advective timescale of a `model` restricted to the directions of
`formulation`: `HorizontalFormulation()` counts only the horizontal advective CFL (dropping the
vertical term), `ThreeDimensionalFormulation()` counts all three directions. Pass it to the
`cell_advection_timescale` keyword of `TimeStepWizard` / `conjure_time_step_wizard!`, or as the
`timescale` argument of `CFL` (`CFL(Δt, CellAdvectionTimescale(...))`), to control or monitor
which directions bind the time step.
