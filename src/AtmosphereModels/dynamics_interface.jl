Return the *coupling density* — the density weighting the momentum (`ρu = ρᵈ u`) and the
thermodynamic flux variable (`ρθ = ρᵈ θ`), and the divisor for diagnosing velocity (`u = ρu/ρᵈ`)
and potential temperature (`θ = ρθ/ρᵈ`). It is the prognostic mass variable advanced by continuity.

- `AnelasticDynamics`: the time-independent reference density `ρᵣ`.
- `CompressibleDynamics`: the prognostic dry-air density `ρᵈ`.

The *total* air density `ρ = ρᵈ + Σ ρˣ` (dry air plus every water species) is a separate, diagnosed
quantity — see [`total_density`](@ref) — used wherever total mass enters the physics: the
moisture **mass-fraction** recovery (`qˣ = ρˣ/ρ`, so the thermodynamics stays in mass fractions),
scalar and water advection, the equation of state, and buoyancy. The water densities (`ρqᵛ`, `ρqˡ`,
…) are stored as partial densities (mass per volume), *not* coupling-weighted. On the anelastic core
the two densities coincide (`total_density === dynamics_density`).

Return the total air density ρ = ρᵈ + Σρˣ used by the thermodynamics, scalar advection,
equation of state, and buoyancy. Defaults to [`dynamics_density`](@ref) — correct for
formulations with a single density (e.g. the anelastic reference density). `CompressibleDynamics`
overrides it with a diagnosed total-density field, distinct from the coupling density ρᵈ.
"""

    advecting_vertical_velocity(dynamics, velocities)

Return the vertical velocity that advects momentum through the grid's coordinate surfaces:
the Cartesian `velocities.w` on height-coordinate grids, and the contravariant vertical
velocity `w̃` on terrain-following grids (mirroring [`advecting_momentum`](@ref), whose
vertical component is the contravariant momentum). The adaptive-implicit vertical-advection
split must partition this velocity on both the explicit (flux-scaling) and implicit
(tridiagonal) sides, so it stays consistent with the momentum flux divergence.

Validate that velocity boundary conditions are only provided for dynamics that support them.

By default, throws an error if the user provides boundary conditions for `:u`, `:v`, or `:w`,
since velocity is a diagnostic field for most dynamics (e.g., anelastic, compressible).

regular fields that can be set directly.

Return a reference state with `pressure`, `density`, and `standard_pressure` fields
suitable for constructing boundary-condition diagnostics (e.g. virtual potential
temperature for stability-dependent bulk fluxes).

Boundary conditions are materialized before `materialize_dynamics` runs, so this
hook lets each dynamics type decide what to expose at that point. The default

constructs a fully-built reference state up front (e.g. `AnelasticDynamics`).

either absent or supplied up front. `true` for compressible dynamics *that were not given an
explicit reference profile* (the default `reference_state = :auto`): their reference is built by
default and best deduced from the initial state's horizontal mean — on both height-coordinate and
terrain-following grids. When an explicit reference profile was supplied at construction it is
authoritative, so this stays `false` and `set!` leaves it untouched. An explicit

Return a default surface temperature for `BulkDrag` when the user has not supplied
one. Dispatched on the dynamics type because the notion of a "default" surface
temperature depends on what reference structure the dynamics carries: anelastic
has a full reference profile whose surface value is well-defined; compressible
has no equivalent up-front surface temperature and therefore requires the user
to provide one explicitly.

this hook.
