# # Kinematic driver: cloud formation in an idealized updraft
#
# In atmospheric modeling, we sometimes want to isolate microphysics and thermodynamics
# from dynamics. **Kinematic models** prescribe the velocity field rather than solving
# momentum equations, letting us focus purely on tracer transport and phase changes.
#
# This example demonstrates Breeze's [`PrescribedDynamics`](@ref) formulation by simulating
# cloud formation in an idealized updraft. A uniform vertical velocity lifts moist air
# through a realistic temperature profile. As air rises and cools, water vapor
# condenses to form clouds — a fundamental process driving all precipitation on Earth.
#
# ## Physical setup
#
# We simulate a 1D column representing a rising air parcel with:
# - A realistic potential temperature profile (troposphere + stratosphere)
# - Uniform upward velocity `W₀ = 2 m/s` (a gentle cumulus updraft)
# - Moist boundary layer air entering from below
#
# The **divergence correction** option compensates for the non-zero mass flux divergence
# ∇·(ρU) that arises when velocity doesn't vary with the reference density profile.
# This is essential for physically consistent tracer advection in kinematic models.

# ## Grid and reference state
#
# We construct a 20 km tall column extending from the surface through the tropopause
# into the lower stratosphere. The reference state establishes the background
# pressure and density profile based on a hydrostatically-balanced atmosphere.

Nz = 100
Lz = 20000 # 20 km domain height
grid = RectilinearGrid(CPU(); size=Nz, x=0, y=0, z=(0, Lz),
                       topology=(Flat, Flat, Bounded))

constants = ThermodynamicConstants()
θ₀ = 300   # Surface potential temperature (K)
p₀ = 1e5   # Surface pressure (Pa)
reference_state = ReferenceState(grid, constants;
                                 surface_pressure=p₀,
                                 potential_temperature=θ₀)

# ## Prescribing dynamics with divergence correction
#
# The key feature of kinematic models is [`PrescribedDynamics`](@ref), which fixes
# the density and pressure fields from a reference state. We enable
# `divergence_correction=true` because our constant vertical velocity doesn't
# satisfy the anelastic continuity constraint ∇·(ρU) = 0.
#
# Without this correction, the tracer equation would see spurious sources/sinks
# from the non-zero velocity divergence. The correction adds a term `c ∇·(ρU)`
# that compensates for the prescribed velocity field's divergence.

W₀ = 2 # Vertical velocity (m/s) — a gentle updraft
dynamics = PrescribedDynamics(reference_state; divergence_correction=true)

# ## Boundary conditions
#
# The key boundary condition is at the surface: we prescribe incoming moist air
# with constant potential temperature and specific humidity. This represents
# the boundary layer air being lifted into the updraft.

ρ₀ = surface_density(reference_state)

# Surface boundary conditions for tracers
qᵗ₀ = 0.018 # Incoming specific humidity (18 g/kg) — typical tropical boundary layer
ρθ_bcs = FieldBoundaryConditions(bottom=ValueBoundaryCondition(ρ₀ * θ₀))
ρqᵗ_bcs = FieldBoundaryConditions(bottom=ValueBoundaryCondition(ρ₀ * qᵗ₀))
w_bcs = FieldBoundaryConditions(bottom=OpenBoundaryCondition(W₀), top=OpenBoundaryCondition(W₀))

# ## Microphysics: warm-phase saturation adjustment
#
# We use [`SaturationAdjustment`](@ref) with [`WarmPhaseEquilibrium`](@ref), which
# instantaneously partitions total water between vapor and liquid based on
# saturation. When air becomes supersaturated, excess vapor condenses to cloud
# liquid, releasing latent heat. This captures the essence of cloud formation
# without explicit condensation timescales.

microphysics = SaturationAdjustment(equilibrium=WarmPhaseEquilibrium())

# ## Building the atmosphere model
#
# We assemble all components into an [`AtmosphereModel`](@ref). The combination
# of `PrescribedDynamics` with microphysics creates a powerful tool for
# understanding cloud processes in isolation from dynamics.

# ## Discussion
#
# The kinematic driver framework enables focused study of cloud microphysics by
# decoupling them from dynamical feedbacks. Key observations from this simulation:
#
# 1. **Cloud base formation**: Moist boundary layer air rises and cools adiabatically.
#    When it reaches its Lifting Condensation Level (LCL), condensation begins
#    and cloud liquid appears. The sharp transition in qˡ marks the cloud base.
#
# 2. **Moisture partitioning**: Above the cloud base, total water is partitioned
#    between vapor (at saturation) and liquid (the excess). Water vapor decreases
#    with height because saturation vapor pressure decreases with temperature.
#
# 3. **Potential temperature**: Initially, θ increases with height. As the simulation
#    progresses, latent heat release from condensation modifies the temperature
#    profile within the cloud layer.
#
# 4. **Divergence correction**: Without `divergence_correction=true`, the constant
#    velocity field would create spurious tracer sources because ∇·(ρW) ≠ 0.
#    The correction adds a compensating term to the tracer equations.
#
# This setup is analogous to classic parcel theory experiments in cloud physics,
# but resolved on a grid. It's particularly useful for:
# - Testing and validating microphysics schemes in isolation
# - Understanding sensitivities to initial moisture and temperature
# - Pedagogical demonstrations of cloud formation physics
#
# For more complex microphysics including rain formation, see the
# [`BulkMicrophysics`](@ref) schemes available through the CloudMicrophysics extension,
# or the [`stationary_parcel_model.jl`](@ref) example.
